   PUJA CONFIG — EVERY ASSUMED FACT LIVES HERE.
   These values were assumed to get the site built and are almost certainly
   not final. Correct them here and the whole site updates; nothing below
   this block hard-codes a date, a place or an amount.

     dates    — ASSUMED. Durga Puja 2026 tithi not confirmed.
     venue    — ASSUMED. No pandal site confirmed.
     ceremony — ASSUMED. Which evening the awards run.
     contact  — DELIBERATELY EMPTY. No phone or email has been invented.
                Fill these in and the "reach us directly" block appears by
                itself. Until then the enquiry form is the only route, which
                is safe: it goes to your database, not to a stranger's phone.
     tiers    — ASSUMED amounts. Real pricing is a BKS decision.
